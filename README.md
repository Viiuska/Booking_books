# Booking_books  
### Distributed Systems Final Project  

This project is simple booking system for books that has at the moment registration, authentication, profile, and search engine for books. 
In the future it would have the book reservation function working as well.  


This project uses older versions of the dependencies. 
They can be found in the package.json file. Node version is 12.12.12 and Angular uses **npm install -g angular-cli** version.

## How to run it   
Open two terminal windows.  
1. window write **npm start**
2. window (I prefer bash) write **cd angular-src** and then **ng serve**  
Open for example Google Chrome *http://localhost:4200*
